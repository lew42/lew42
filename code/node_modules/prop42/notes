- Needs to mimic normal prototypical overrides, at least in "auto" mode...
- If we want to inspect, we don't want to destroy the functionality when its turned off for production...


Mod({
	log: true // --> auto wraps everything
		// wraps props
		// wraps methods
});


Does this wrap post-set?  Otherwise we need to turn it on before that.
For this reason, maybe its best to use a different module class...


How do I keep these things simple, yet mess around with some complex shit?  Ugh...
