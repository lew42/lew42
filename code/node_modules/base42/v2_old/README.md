# Base2

There's really no need for a simpler version.  If we want to put log statements in the functions, then we need the .log property to exist.

# Base vs Mod

`mod = Mod()` is way better than `base = Base()`, or referencing `var base = some.ref` or `var obj = some.ref`...

Using the term "mod" as a generic.. thing, seems to make sense.  I should clean these up, and make sure its clear what is what..

Maybe just call instances of a Base class a mod also...?

Maybe Base could be stored at Mod.Base?










### TODO: Uninstall the .log getter, and make permanently assign the disabled noop logger.  Maybe .set({ log: null }), as a special case?

##  Actually, the default should be a permanent noop logger... 

Or, like the createConstructor, we need to have some environment variables.

> if (prod) // default log state is null
> if (dev) // default log state is auto (uses ES5 getter...)

And you could flip a config option for the default logger state aside from dev/prod modes.
