# Base2

Without .assign, we still have a lot of work to do.  Base1 is basically just for example...

To avoid making Base139, I could move Base1 into an example or progression folder.  I don't think I'll need to actually extend from Base1 (new .extend, new .createConstructor, basically means we can just start over...);
