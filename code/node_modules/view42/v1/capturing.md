# capturing

Does this run immediately if we're not in a capture fn?
Capture fn vs current captor?  The document view could be set as the default captor, so any time a view is created that's not in a capture group, it gets added to the document?


View.extend({
	sub: View(function(){
		this shouldn't run.  this view shouldn't get appended to the document...
	})
});

View("something"); // if this is outside another capture group, this "writes" to the document?  It's not a bad idea...

That whole "auto-write" thing could be configured.  Normally speaking, you should always be within another capture group, or specify the linkage directly.  Using that auto-write behavior is a little unpredictable.


So, does this run immediately?  Not sure...
If not, when would it run?  It could attempt capture.  If no capture, it could run immediately.  But does it get appended anywhere?  Probably not.. It can build itself if its not captured (and doesn't rely on any undefined refs..).

View(function(){ // this is a build fn

	View("string"); // this can be captured immediately
		// this is anonymous, and can't be referenced, unless you do
	this.handle = View("string");

	// or, just use the class/name shorthand
	View(".handle", "string");
	// now this.handle === that view
	// also, we addClass("handle") for convenience

	View("span.yo", "string"); // should definitely support tag, id, and multiple classes

	View("span.yo", "string", View.Attr({ "data-whatever": "value" }));

	View({
		tag: "span",
		name: "yo", // --> addClass("yo"), adopts as ".yo"
		addClass: "another",
		removeClass: "remove-me", // if the base View has one we want to remove...
		content: "string"
	});

	View(".sub", function(){ // this is a build fn
		// we can't be sure whether this is being assigned to an intermediary, so we can't run this function until we're sure (because we need this.parent to be accurate);

		this.parent; // should always reference the correct parent View.

		// So, we temporarily grab the current captor
	});


	View({
		name: "directSub",
		sub: View(function(){
			this.parent === this.root.directSub;
			this === this.parent.sub;
			this.parent.siblings; // also benefits from delayed execution
		}),
		another: View("simple")
	});


	AT THE END OF THE BUILD FN, THEN WE SHOULD HAVE OUR OFFICIAL CAPTIVES
	--> IF THEY'RE RECAPTURED, THEY SHOULD NO LONGER BE A CHILD/CONTENT[]

	Once we have the official children, we can loop through all content[], and run
