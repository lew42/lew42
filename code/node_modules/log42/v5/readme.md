* decouple proxy stuff with console and/or views
* decouple log output from arg config

LogArg:
* stores its own .active state, so that arg: { name: false } doesn't need to noop - it's just an object that... noops itself
* build/compose log args without the funky api...

new Arg()
arg.add(anotherArg, )
