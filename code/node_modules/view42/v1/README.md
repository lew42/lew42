Having views as hierarchy of modules is really important:

View({
	sub: View({
		subSub: ...
	})
});

So that you can then access all the things.
* Probably want some aliasing and adoption, so `this.mod`, for example, is always available.



var Thing = Mod.extend({
	view: View({
		...
	}),
	render: function(){
		// must be decoupled...
		return this.view.clone.apply(this.view, arguments.push({
			thing: this,
			other: this.aliasing
		}));
	}
});





# View 1

* Synchronous
* Coupled
* Useful for debugging (1:1 between obj and view)


With proxies, to debug, we might not need any... 'events'.  Just use the log api established.
Instead of console.logging, we can put it in the DOM!

Wrap the DOM?  Or just provide some helpers for creating it, and then use the DOM directly?


For managing events, update fns, and mappings (set({ subView --> do something special }))

It seems like wrapping would be helpful... But not necessary... You should be able to work with dom directly, if you want...

# "Read-only" prototype views

If views are only used to be .cloned....?

this.append(this.sub.clone())

If they're "immutable", you can try to avoid modifying them.  You only read them..

If you create a new View:

var MyView = View.extend({
	sub: View("yo"),
	body: View(function(){
		if (this.parent.parent.something)
			this.append(this.parent.one());

	}),
	one: function(){
		this.$one = 
	}
});




Hmm... substituting .clone() w/ auto-render for auto-clone is interesting:

if (this.parent.something){
	this.append(this.one.clone());
} else {
	this.append(this.two.clone({ parent: this.parent }));
}



# Efficient update fn

initialize/render:
this.myTextNode = this.append("yo");
this.myTextNode.textContent = this.mod.prop;

The problem comes in when you have conditional rendering.  For example,

if (condition)
	// use view1
else
	// use view2

// for... coupled views, its not as likely.  If you really need to hide/show/add/remove a bunch of things conditionally, then... you could make your update fn do it.

But, for most simple views, you probably don't need to do much of that.
