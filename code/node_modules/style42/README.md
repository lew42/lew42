view42 should be the single requirement for the base css/less, style guide, etc.

Should style guides be optional?  devDeps?
Some sites might want to publish certain parts of the style guide, whereas most sites probably won't...

If you use views, you'll want to simultaneously build out a style guide...

That style guide might just be for dev...

If you npm i view42, it should definitely install style42...?
Or, maybe you var style = require("style42"), and

style("name", function(){}); // ...


It seems then, you could use views without style guide... Optionally install style if you want it...
