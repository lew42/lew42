I'm thinking the best way to do this is to prevent all constructs from being .set until after adoption.

The easiest way to do that, is to just store all .instantiate arguments as .build, and then in initialize, we this.set.apply(this, this.build);








View("str", {}, fn(){ this.parent; /*not available, if we run immediately*/ })

How do we delay execution?  If we want to support multiple functions.. 
- We'd need to store them all, but in the same order as they come in (alongside the other content).  Instead of appending the str/views, and waiting on the delayed views, we should just store them all and append all at once.
- This could be done via a .build array, or .args reference...

View(function(){
	var parent = this;

	this.append({
		sub: View(function(){
			this.parent === parent;
			this.parent.sub === this;
		})
	});

	View(".sub", function(){

	});



});
