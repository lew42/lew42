View("hello", "world"); --> "helloworld"
view.set("hello", "world") --> "helloworld"
view.set("hello").set("world") --> "world"

To get the results you'd probably expect, you could switch a mode from "auto" to "append" if you always wanted .set to append:

view.set({
	set: {
		contentMode: "auto" || "append" || "reset"
	}
});

Auto would keep it in "reset" mode, but would flip to "append" mode during a set call.  So...

view.set("hi"); --> "hi"
view.set("hello", "world") --> "helloworld"

but

view.set("hi"); --> "hi"
view.set("hello").set("world") --> "world"
