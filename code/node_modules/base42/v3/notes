Base + log

log.wrap --> noop for disabled logger, wraps for enabled logger


Method configuration..?
For a Base module that only assigns...



Should assignedTo be converted to .assignTo()?
Its basically the same thing, only instead of being a "callback", it's an inversion of control, and the "assignTo" function actually has to do the assignment?

Sure, let's try it.
