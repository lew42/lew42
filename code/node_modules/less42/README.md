This could just be a base set of less building blocks.

These building blocks should probably be "abstract" classes?

But then you can't compose with them in the browser (by adding/removing css classes).  

Maybe, then, there should be a require("less42/dev") that includes all the recipes as individual building blocks, which produces a much larger css file.

Then, a less42/prod can be an optimized version, that excludes as much as possible.
