Use contextual constructors for sub log methods?

this.log.something *is* a constructor
--> uses `this` === the .log, and creates a new Something({ ctx: this });

And then it can be easily extended:

Logger.extend({
	something: {
		...
	}
});

And you have 1 api point (instead of .something(){ new this.Something() }, where you'd have to extend({ Something }) and call log.something()...)

Just a minor convenience, I suppose...




Method summaries

We'll need delayed logging to be able to look at the return value, and wrap it all up?

I mean - it could happen synchronously.  By just appending to the views.. And that's probably not a bad idea, so that you can watch your view change as your debugging.

I think an integrated solution between the debugger, console, and views is probably the best approach.  Some thing will be easiest to just dump into the console.  Some things will be nice to see in the view
